# Sprint 1: Design
6-Day project to get familiar with design process of software and Terminal-Program communication


As a developer I want to be able to track the time that I spend on a named task so that I can report accurate times to my manager.

1. The application needs to log the time that work began on a particular task.
2. The application needs to log the time that work stopped on a particular task.
3. The application needs to be able to record a description for a particular task.
4. The application needs to provide a summary of the time spent on a particular task.
5. The application needs to provide a  summary report for all tasks.
